This project helped me to consolidate knowledge on React fundamentals like:

- Context
- Hooks
- React Imutability fundamentals

I learned about conditional renders on React and how to share info through the components

I had to refactor the code on:

- useCart context and hook
- Show data on Cart and Home pages

The tests was made by Rocketseat team, and the grade was gave by Rocketseat's platform!
